# Experimental setup

(ref:exp-setup) **A**: Experimental setup, with two test boxes side-by-side (denoted as "L" for left and "R" for right). Each test box contains one test tank, separated by removable barriers into quadrants, allowing for the simultaneous assay of four pairs of fish per test tank. The interior of the box is ambiently illuminated by LED lights, and a camera is suspended over the centre of each test tank to record the videos. **B**: Four pairs of fishes in a test tank with labelled quadrants (I, II, III, IV) and lines (iCab or HdrR). **C**: Paths of iCab reference fish and HdrR test fish from the video at panel (B) at 110 seconds.
