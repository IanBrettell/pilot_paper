# About

This notebook sets out a selection of analyses for the pilot study on medaka bold-shy behaviours using 5 established inbred strains (*iCab*, *HdrR*, *Kaga*, *HNI*, and *HO5*).

## Videos

These videos showcase an example of the data and HMM movement classifications for each of the 5 lines. Set the quality to HD when viewing.

Each video displays one 10-minute open field assay with 4 pairs of fish, sped up by 10x.

Top left is the raw video with labelled fishes.

Top right are the paths of both fish.

Bottom left are the paths of the test fish (either *iCab*, *HdrR*, *Kaga*, *HNI*, or *HO5*), coloured by HMM state.

Bottom right are the paths of the reference *iCab* fish, coloured by HMM state.
